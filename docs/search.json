    "text": "Hello, my name is Egemen Onat Atam. I graduated from Business and Law departments of MEF University. After working as a lawyer for a while, I resigned about 2 months ago. At that time, my master’s application was finalized and I wanted to give my full focus to this department. I want to develop myself further by synthesizing the competencies I already have with the achievements I will gained in this program. For instance, Data science, machine learning and big data analysis can be and will be beneficial in the field of law. Although the legal sector has difficulties in adopting a new technology and integrating it with them, it will not be able to escape from digitalization sooner or later. As a matter of fact, the data created by the legal system is increasing and digitizing day by day, and we see that case decisions and case-laws are now transmitted and stored electronically, especially with the UYAP (National Judicial Network Information System). Also, such matchups of attorneys with machine learning, big data, and analytics offer a potent combination that may help law firms better and more effectively serve their clients while also figuring out methods to set themselves apart from rivals, do a better job of keeping clients, and bring in new ones. While this change is taking place, I want to be a part of this process with the competencies that this program has given me."

There are 5 advantages below:\n\nFree and Open Source\nExtensive support for statistical modelling\nExtremely easy data wrangling\nThe connection with NoSQL databases\nAdvanced visualizations\n\nLink\n\n\n1.3.2 Python vs. R In Data Science & Machine Learning\nIn article there is a comparison between R and Python. It starts with differences between them. Then switch to similarities. These differences and similarities are mainly in syntax, libraries, and community support. After finishing comparison article asks and answers this question, which one should we learn to become a data scientist? It tells us the choosing between R and Python depends to our programming skills. Also, it depends which type of data science we want. If we want to focus more on machine learning R is more suitable. İF we want to become Excel Wizz then python is our language. Towards the end of the article, the use of two programming languages in the field of artificial intelligence is mentioned.\nLink\n\n\n1.3.3 20 Useful R Packages You May Not Know About\nThe packages/add-ins cover in this article: Reading data: datapasta, vroom, rio Data cleaning: naniar, skimr, janitor, sqldf, reticulate Data analysis: effectsize,compareGroups Data visualization: esquisse, ggThemeAssist, ggcor, ggstatsplot, ggtech, rayshader Misc: beepr, emo, calendR, todor\nLink"
